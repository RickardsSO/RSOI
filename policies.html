            <h3>General Science Olympiad Rules</h3>
            <p>
                All participants are expected to follow Science Olympiad Rules
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Each division C team can have a maximumn of 7 seniors and each Divison B team can have a maximumn of 5 9th grade students.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Each team must be registered with their State Science Olympiad to participate. 
                </li>

                <li>
                    Each team may have as many alternates as they wish, but the alternates may only participate in Trial Events.                 
                </li>
            </ul>


            <h3>RSOI Policies</h3>
            <p>
                These policies are also on the event modifications document
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        This year, we will have normal length tests!
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        All note sheets (events that require 8.5 * 11-inch piece(s) of paper) must be printed out. However, online binders will be allowed.
                    </li>
                        
                    <li>
                        For note sheets, teams are allowed to have a page with different information for each competitor. Online binders need to be in the same document.             
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>SATELLITE ONLY -</b> Event Supervisors will keep track of "time out of browser". If a team spends more than 30 seconds, they will be tiered. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Events that are supposed to have stations will give all questions at the same time to be completed within 50 minutes.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Participants may use any method of communication such as video call, voice chat, or the built-in Scilympiad chat.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        All events are 50 minutes long unless event modifications state differently.
                        No-shows will result in n+1 points.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Events follow <b>national</b> rules.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The final team score will not be influenced by trial events
                    </li>
                </ul>
