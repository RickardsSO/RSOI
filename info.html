		<p>
            We will be having both a Mini and a Satellite competition for division B and C.<br>
            Per the SIONIC website, those who wish to attend the Satellite competition must take the tests under the supervision of their coach
            and those attending the Mini competition must have all members be in remote areas. Our tournament is asynchronous,
            meaning teams can participate in the 50 minute events anytime during the competition (Nov 4-11).

                <b>Fun Events.</b> One of our main goals is for competitiors to enjoy our competition and being an early season competition, we also want
                competitors to be able to bond with their team, therefore, we have trial events such as Anagrams, Anything Goes, Geoguessr, etc.
