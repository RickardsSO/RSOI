          We will be having both a Mini and a Satellite competition for division B and C.<br>
          Per the SIONIC website, those who wish to attend the Satellite competition must take the tests under the supervision of their coach
          and those attending the Mini competition must have all members be in remote areas. Our tournament is asynchronous,
          meaning teams can participate in the 50 minute events anytime during the competition. The tournament start Nov. 2 at 8:00 AM
          EDT and end on Nov. 9 at 6:00 PM EST
        </p-->
        <p>
          We will be hosting a one week Satellite competition for division B and C that will take place on the first week of November.<br><br>

          
          Per the SOINC website, those who wish to attend the Satellite competition must take the tests under the supervision of their coach.
          Students may take tests anywhere as long as all members taking the tests are present and under a coach's supervision. Our tournament is asynchronous,
          meaning teams can participate in the 50 minute events anytime during the competition. Students on the team but not actively taking tests do not need to all be at their test-taking location.
          The tournament starts Nov. 2 at 8:00 AM
          EDT and ends on Nov. 9 at 11:00 PM EST. 
          
          We encourage teams from the same school to take tests for a certain event at the same time to ensure academic honesty. 
        </P>
